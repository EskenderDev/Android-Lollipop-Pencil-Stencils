## Installation

2. Create a .zip of everything **inside** the cloned/extracted folder (not the folder itself)
3. In Pencil, install the .zip via _Tools_ > _Install new collection..._
4. Make sure the _Hide Heavy Elements_ option in the _View_ menu is **unchecked**

### Updating
Right-click on the collection in Pencil's sidebar and choose _Uninstall this collection_ before repeating the installation steps.

## Notes
Works best with the Roboto font installed.

To change between Roboto's various font weights, use the _Font Weight_ option in the element right-click menu.
