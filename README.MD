# Android Lollipop Stencils for Pencil

Collection of common Android Lollipop UI elements for Pencil ([pencil.evolus.vn](http://pencil.evolus.vn/)).

See [#2](/../../issues/2) for a list of included components - requests & contributions welcome!

## Installation
1. Either clone this repo or [download it as a .zip](https://github.com/nathanielw/Andriod-Lollipop-Pencil-Stencils/archive/master.zip) and extract the contents
2. Create a .zip of everything **inside** the cloned/extracted folder (not the folder itself)
3. In Pencil, install the .zip via _Tools_ > _Install new collection..._

## Notes
Works best with the Roboto font installed.

If an element's text looks too heavy/bold, try selecting "Force Roboto font" from the item's right-click menu. (Pencil doesn't give control over font weights beyond normal or bold, which causes some problems)
